# About
I am currently a PhD student at [Christian Doppler (CD) Laboratory ATHENA](https://athena.itec.aau.at/), based at the Institute of Information Technology (ITEC), University of Klagenfurt. I am fortunate to be advised by [Christian Timmerer](https://multimediacommunication.blogspot.com/p/about.html) and [Hadi Amirpour](https://hadiamirpour.github.io/index.html). I received my Master of Engineering degree in Electronics and Digital Technology from Polytech Nantes, and received my bachelor's degree in Information Engineering from South China University of Technology.

I am interested in video streaming, video compression, and deep learning in general. My PhD research focuses on exploring advanced video compression using deep learning techniques.
